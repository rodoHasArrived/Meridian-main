## Getting Started

### For New Contributors

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Run `dotnet format` before committing
5. Open a PR - workflows run automatically
6. Address any feedback from automated checks

### For Maintainers

1. **Creating a Release**:
   - Actions → Release Management
   - Enter version (e.g., `v1.6.0`)
   - Workflow handles rest

2. **Reviewing Security**:
   - Check Security tab weekly
   - Review Dependabot PRs
   - Monitor CodeQL alerts

3. **Managing Workflows**:
   - Most run automatically
   - Manual triggers available in Actions tab
   - Check workflow documentation in `.github/workflows/README.md`
