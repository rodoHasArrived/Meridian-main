# src/Meridian.Contracts

## Purpose

Meridian contracts contains shared DTOs and cross-layer contracts used by host, services,
dashboard, and WPF.

## Layer responsibility

This module owns stable transport payloads, compatibility-safe DTOs, and shared schema objects.
Consumers depend on contracts; contracts should not depend on host, UI, application orchestration,
or provider implementations.

## Key folders and files

- `Workstation/` - workstation and operator workflow DTOs.
- Contract DTO files - shared payloads consumed across host, UI services, desktop, and dashboard.
- Project metadata - serialization and package references for contract consumers.

## Important workflows

Treat additive and breaking changes as cross-module compatibility work. Operations Continuity
workflow DTOs publish the shared broker intake, Security Master, ledger posting, reconciliation,
approval, close, and audit vocabulary consumed by both browser and WPF workstation clients. Keep
returned workflow blocker codes in `OperationsWorkflowContractMatrix.BlockerCodes`, including
ledger journal context-validation failures, so clients can handle command failures without parsing
messages. Close-checklist control approval blockers are part of that shared vocabulary and must
remain contract-owned rather than browser-only or WPF-only state.

Brokerage sync activity payloads are fund-account scoped under `Workstation/BrokerageSyncDtos.cs`.
Keep readiness and work-item decisions on `WorkstationBrokerageSyncStatusDto` and reserve
`FundAccountBrokerageSyncActivityDto` for durable account-level evidence, positions, orders, fills,
and cash-transaction details.

## Validation

```bash
dotnet test tests/Meridian.Tests/Meridian.Tests.csproj --filter "Category!=Integration" --logger "console;verbosity=normal"
```

## Change rules

Prefer additive DTO changes when possible. Update shared compatibility tests and generated docs when
contract shape, blocker vocabulary, or route-visible payloads change.
