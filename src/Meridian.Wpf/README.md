# src/Meridian.Wpf

## Purpose

WPF workstation is the active Windows desktop operator workstation sharing contracts and read models
with the browser workstation.

## Layer responsibility

This module owns the desktop shell, WPF pages, route hosting, and desktop workstation view models.
Keep shared contracts and read-model logic in shared UI services when browser and desktop both need
the behavior. The seven operator workspaces now register through feature modules under
`src/Meridian.Wpf/Features/` so new workspace-level navigation and shell ownership lands in the
matching module before it expands through the older flat page folders.

## Key folders and files

- `Features/` - workspace-owned module registration for Trading, Portfolio, Accounting, Reporting,
  Strategy, Data, and Settings.
- `ViewModels/` - desktop operator workflow view models.
- `Views/` - WPF pages and controls.
- `Shell/` and `Services/` - navigation, route, launch, and desktop service seams.

## Important workflows

Keep desktop support aligned with shared contracts and governance posture.
Convention-based view-model wiring is handled by `Services/ViewModelViewResolver.cs`; shell pages
that follow the `*Page` to `*ViewModel` naming convention can receive a DI-constructed DataContext
without page-specific registration, while pages that set their own DataContext remain authoritative.
Runtime desktop capability toggles are declared by feature modules and surfaced in Settings through
the feature capability gate. The Security Master page projects the workstation trust
snapshot's `scheduleBook` and `openLotReadModel` payloads into operator-visible schedule, factor,
provenance, and open-lot review sections.
Run Cash Flow consumes `StrategyRunContinuityService` when the desktop shell provides it, so the
cash-flow drill-in presents the same run, portfolio, ledger, cash-flow, reconciliation, and warning
posture used by shared workstation continuity endpoints.
Fund Ledger reconciliation actions call the shared workstation reconciliation endpoints for review,
assignment, status transition, comments, taxonomy, resolution, sign-off, reopen, audit timeline, and
bulk casework behavior, then refresh the
queue from the shared break read model after review/resolve/dismiss, and keep the selected decision
note, audit event, and pending close sign-off posture visible in the retained detail panel.
Shared workstation affordance primitives under `Workstation/Models` and `Workstation/Controls`
standardize action posture, readiness tone, evidence links, recovery actions, and sign-off
requirements for W4 close/report surfaces. Fund Ledger reconciliation and Report Pack handoff
surfaces consume these primitives so blocker, evidence, recovery, and sign-off signifiers stay
visible without creating desktop-only business rules.

## Validation

```powershell
dotnet test tests/Meridian.Wpf.Tests/Meridian.Wpf.Tests.csproj /p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true /p:EnableFullWpfBuild=true --logger "console;verbosity=normal"
```

## Change rules

Keep WPF views declarative and move loading, disabled, preview, empty-state, and status-copy
behavior into view models. Do not duplicate product logic that belongs in shared UI services.
