# src/Meridian.Ui.Shared

## Purpose

UI shared contains shared UI read models and compatibility shims for browser and desktop surfaces.

## Layer responsibility

This module owns cross-surface operator-facing projection types and shared endpoint helpers. Preserve
compatibility across `src/Meridian.Ui.Services`, `src/Meridian.Ui/dashboard`, and
`src/Meridian.Wpf`.

## Key folders and files

- `Endpoints/` - shared workstation endpoint mapping and projection helpers.
- Shared read models - DTOs and compatibility shims consumed by browser and desktop clients.
- Project metadata - UI shared dependencies and build settings.

## Important workflows

Preserve cross-surface compatibility when evolving shared read models. Keep ledger/reconciliation
source-of-truth services authoritative. Workstation endpoint registration is split by domain through
`WorkstationEndpoints.*.cs` partial files. Keep the root `WorkstationEndpoints.cs` file as the
coordinator, route new domain-specific endpoint edits to the matching partial file, and avoid
concurrent branches that both modify the root coordinator or the shared
`WorkstationEndpointsTests.cs` test body. For operations-continuity and reconciliation endpoint
changes, start with focused `MapWorkstationEndpoints_OperationsContinuity` /
`MapWorkstationEndpoints_Reconciliation` filters before broad workstation endpoint validation.
Report-pack workflow state is shared here as well: publication requires sign-off, evidence hash,
retained manifest metadata, and retained evidence links for every report-line provenance pointer so
browser and WPF clients do not invent local lifecycle or no-orphan-evidence rules.
Evidence packet validation also owns the shared SLA/freshness policy and Meridian Assurance Score
calculation for provider validation, replay, reconciliation, approval, and reporting evidence so
client surfaces consume the same readiness posture instead of recalculating it locally.
Provider-ledger reconciliation is shared service/API behavior: it reads the latest brokerage sync
projection, compares it with the internal fund-account balance snapshot, validates Security Master
coverage, and retains the latest detail under workstation data for browser and WPF clients to
consume later without adding client-specific reconciliation logic. Break records preserve stable
keys, owner assignment, tolerance, first/last-observed aging, and sign-off state from the previous
latest detail so repeated provider-ledger variances can be controlled as accounting casework.
Reconciliation casework hardening also lives in the shared contract/API lane: assignment,
priority, SLA policy and breach state, lifecycle transition guardrails, threaded comments, taxonomy
codes, sign-off/reopen metadata, immutable audit events, optimistic concurrency versions, and bulk
triage endpoints are modeled in `Meridian.Contracts.Workstation` and served from the shared
workstation reconciliation endpoint family so browser and WPF clients consume the same accounting
workflow instead of implementing surface-local rules.
Reconciliation details also emit provider-to-Security-Master confidence passports for every
provider position, preserving the resolution path, confidence score, validation issue codes, and
identifier-conflict evidence alongside the persisted accounting detail.

Fund-structure endpoints expose `/api/fund-structure/ledger-mapping-view` as the shared accounting
control surface for account ledger mappings. The endpoint returns server-derived assignment source,
unmapped-account issue codes, and recommended action so browser and WPF surfaces do not invent
client-local mapping or posting readiness rules.
When provider-routing capability metadata is registered, the reconciliation service blocks runs
that cannot route account balances, account positions, or reconciliation-feed capability for the
fund account, so unsupported providers fail as accounting break evidence before ledger comparison.
Positioned accounts also require corporate-action capability as a valuation-readiness signal; if
that capability is unavailable, reconciliation can still run but records a degradation break for
controller review.

## Security and credentials

`LoginSessionService` stores the authenticated `UserProfile` for each in-memory session so
account-specific permission overrides and role profile names from `MDC_USERS` remain authoritative
for `/api/auth/me` and endpoint authorization checks. Do not reconstruct session users from only the
built-in role label, because that would reapply the full built-in role permission mask and bypass
configured restrictions.

## Validation

```bash
dotnet test tests/Meridian.Ui.Tests/Meridian.Ui.Tests.csproj /p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true --logger "console;verbosity=normal"
```

## Change rules

Do not put browser-only or WPF-only product logic here. Keep shared read models compatible and route
domain-specific endpoint edits to the matching partial file.
