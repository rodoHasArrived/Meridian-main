## 🔌 Data Access & APIs

- **Python SDK** — async iterator over live feed, pandas DataFrame output, `snap()` for last N ticks, `history()` for bulk pull. Wraps the WebSocket/REST HTTP layer already exposed by Meridian.
- **gRPC streaming endpoint** — low-latency alternative to WebSocket for intra-datacenter consumers (e.g., C++ strategy engine consuming from Meridian)
- **Arrow Flight endpoint** — columnar bulk data transfer without REST overhead; natural fit for academic batch pulls
- **GraphQL query API** — flexible ad-hoc querying over stored JSONL data; explorers can filter/aggregate without file access
- **Tick replay API** — serve historical ticks at configurable speed multiplier (1x, 10x, 100x market time); valuable for backtesting engines that need realistic feed simulation
- **Snapshot API** — point-in-time orderbook snapshot endpoint; `GET /api/snapshot/{symbol}?at=2024-01-15T14:30:00Z`
- **WebSocket multiplex protocol** — single connection, multiple symbol subscriptions, backpressure signaling; reduces connection overhead for subscribers with large universes
- **R language bindings** — `reticulate`-free native R package via `.NET Interop` or a thin REST wrapper; academic quant finance community is heavily R-based
- **DuckDB virtual table** — register Meridian's JSONL/Parquet store as a DuckDB external table; enables SQL queries without data movement
- **Event-driven webhooks** — push notifications on configurable triggers (new gap detected, anomaly flagged, backfill complete); enables serverless downstream workflows
- **OpenAPI spec auto-generation** — auto-generate OpenAPI 3.1 spec from Meridian's REST controllers; enables code-gen for any language client

---

## 📊 Data Quality & Validation

- **Cross-provider reconciliation** — when multiple providers are connected, flag ticks where IB and Alpaca disagree by >N bps on the same timestamp; generate quality score per symbol
- **Anomaly detection pipeline** — pluggable anomaly detectors (Z-score, IQR, price spike) that tag suspicious ticks in the JSONL stream without dropping them
- **Data completeness scorecard** — per-symbol dashboard showing: expected ticks per session vs. received, gap count, last gap timestamp, interpolation rate
- **Halts and corporate actions awareness** — ingest halt/resume events and tag data around trading halts; avoid surfacing garbage ticks during circuit breakers
- **Latency attribution** — instrument the full path from provider → storage; report per-provider median/p99 latency in the dashboard; identify if a provider is lagging
- **Synthetic data injection** — for testing: inject synthetic tick sequences that stress-test downstream consumers (flash crash simulation, gap, stale quote)
- **Tick sequence validation** — detect out-of-order timestamps, duplicate sequence numbers, and backwards price jumps that indicate feed issues rather than market events
- **Provider SLA scoring** — track uptime, reconnect frequency, message throughput, and data freshness per provider over rolling windows; generate a weekly provider health report
- **Options chain consistency checks** — validate put-call parity relationships, strike price monotonicity, and expiration date coherence in options data feeds
- **Bid-ask spread anomaly detector** — flag inverted markets, abnormally wide spreads, and locked markets as data quality events distinct from normal market microstructure

---

## ⚡ Performance & Latency

- **Kernel-bypass receive path** — optional DPDK or io_uring path for the IB/FIX socket; bypasses OS TCP stack for sub-100μs receive latency on Linux
- **SIMD tick normalizer** — vectorized price/size parsing using `System.Runtime.Intrinsics`; batch-process raw FIX/ITCH bytes 16 at a time
- **Zero-allocation tick path** — object pooling for `MarketEvent` structs, avoiding GC pressure on the hot path; use `ArrayPool<T>` for intermediate buffers
- **CPU affinity pinning** — pin the receive thread and the storage flush thread to isolated cores; reduce scheduling jitter
- **Lock-free ring buffer** — replace `BoundedChannel` on the critical path with a Disruptor-style ring buffer (LMAX pattern) for guaranteed sub-microsecond handoff
- **Nanosecond timestamps** — upgrade from `DateTime` to `long` nanoseconds since epoch on all hot-path structs; use `Stopwatch.GetTimestamp()` with hardware frequency
- **Batched WAL writes** — group WAL entries into 4KB aligned blocks for sequential disk write optimization; measure with `fio` before/after
- **GC-tuned server mode** — configure `ServerGC` with region-based collection and `GCLatencyMode.SustainedLowLatency`; document the GC tuning profile as a runbook
- **Hot-path profiling harness** — built-in `BenchmarkDotNet` suite that profiles the tick-receive-to-storage path end-to-end; run as part of CI to detect regressions
- **Memory-mapped file writes** — use `MemoryMappedFile` for WAL/JSONL output on the hot path; avoids kernel buffer copies for sequential append workloads
- **Pipeline backpressure metrics** — expose `BoundedChannel` fill level, drop count, and consumer lag as Prometheus gauges; alert before pipeline saturation

## 🗄️ Storage & Data Formats

- **Parquet/Arrow output** — convert JSONL daily files to Parquet at session close; columnar layout makes pandas/DuckDB queries 10-100x faster
- **QuestDB integration** — optional sink to QuestDB time-series database; enables SQL queries over streaming data with nanosecond timestamps
- **InfluxDB/TimescaleDB sink** — standard TSDB integration for users with existing monitoring infrastructure
- **Tiered cold storage** — auto-migrate data older than N days to S3/Backblaze with Zstd compression; local disk holds only hot tier
- **Deduplication store** — persistent bloom filter + hash store for exactly-once storage guarantees across restarts; currently in-memory only
- **Incremental Parquet compaction** — merge small daily Parquet files into monthly partitions; improves query performance on multi-month backtests
- **Schema evolution** — forward/backward-compatible schema registry for JSONL/Parquet format changes; version tag every file header
- **HDF5 export** — one-click export to HDF5 format for academic users coming from WRDS/TAQ ecosystems; preserves hierarchical symbol/date structure
- **Delta Lake / Iceberg table format** — store market data as a lakehouse table with ACID transactions, time travel, and schema enforcement; enables both streaming ingest and batch analytics
- **Configurable retention policies** — per-symbol or per-asset-class retention rules (e.g., keep L2 data for 30 days, L1 for 1 year, daily OHLCV forever); enforced automatically with compaction

---

## 🔐 Reliability & Production Readiness

- **Multi-provider active-active** — subscribe to the same symbol on two providers simultaneously; merge streams, use cross-provider reconciliation to detect and correct bad ticks
- **Intelligent failover** — when primary provider disconnects, automatically switch to secondary; track gap introduced by failover; backfill from secondary on reconnect
- **Health scoring per symbol** — composite score (0-100) for each symbol based on: tick rate vs. expected, anomaly rate, gap frequency; surface in dashboard as RAG status
- **Alerting engine** — configurable rules: `if health_score(AAPL) < 80 for 5min → notify`; delivery via email, webhook, Slack
- **Chaos mode** — optional fault injection (random disconnect, tick drop, latency spike) for testing downstream resilience; controlled via CLI flag
- **Rolling restart support** — drain in-flight events before shutdown; resume without data loss; important for Kubernetes rolling deployments
- **Multi-region replication** — async replication of JSONL/Parquet files to a secondary region; DR for institutional users

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Refactoring

- **ViewModel extraction audit** — systematically identify code-behind logic in WPF Pages/Windows that should live in ViewModels; produce a migration checklist per view with effort estimates
- **DI container for WPF shell** — introduce `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` into the WPF application host; eliminate manual service wiring and enable constructor injection across all ViewModels
- **Hot-path / cold-path separation** — physically separate the real-time tick pipeline (hot) from config management, backfill orchestration, and UI (cold) into distinct assemblies; enables independent deployment and testing
- **Interface segregation pass** — audit `IMarketDataClient` and `IStorageSink` for ISP violations; split fat interfaces into focused contracts (e.g., `ITickReceiver`, `IOrderBookReceiver`, `IHistoricalFetcher`)
- **Event pipeline modularization** — refactor `EventPipeline` into composable middleware stages (receive → normalize → validate → route → store); each stage independently testable and replaceable
- **Configuration as strongly-typed objects** — replace raw `IConfiguration` indexing with Options pattern (`IOptions<ProviderSettings>`, `IOptions<StorageSettings>`) everywhere; compile-time safety + validation via `IValidateOptions<T>`
- **Shared kernel extraction** — extract domain primitives (Symbol, Timestamp, Price, Quantity, MarketEvent) into a standalone `Meridian.Domain` assembly with zero infrastructure dependencies; consumed by all layers
- **Plugin architecture for sinks** — replace hardcoded storage sink registration with a MEF/plugin-style discovery system; third parties drop a DLL into a `/plugins` folder and it's auto-registered as an `IStorageSink`

---

## 📈 User Growth & Adoption

## 🧹 Technical Debt & Code Quality

- **Mutation testing baseline** — run Stryker.NET against the test suite to measure real test effectiveness beyond line coverage; identify tests that pass regardless of code changes
- **Architecture decision records (ADRs)** — establish a `docs/adr/` directory; document every significant technical decision (why WPF over UWP, why BoundedChannel over Disruptor, why JSONL first); reduces re-litigation
- **Static analysis gate in CI** — add Roslyn analyzers + `.editorconfig` enforcement to the GitHub Actions pipeline; fail the build on MVVM violations (e.g., code-behind referencing services directly)
- **Dead code elimination sweep** — run a coverage + reference analysis to identify unreachable code paths, unused interfaces, and orphaned files left over from the UWP migration; reduce cognitive load
- **Test isolation audit** — identify integration tests that depend on external state (file system, network, time); refactor to use `ITimeProvider`, in-memory file systems, and test doubles; reduce flaky test rate
- **Dependency freshness dashboard** — automated PR (via Dependabot or similar) for NuGet package updates; track how far behind each dependency is; flag security-relevant updates
- **XML doc coverage requirement** — enforce `<summary>` documentation on all public APIs via a Roslyn analyzer; auto-generate API reference docs from XML comments in CI
- **Consistent error handling patterns** — audit and standardize exception handling across the codebase; replace bare `catch (Exception)` blocks with typed exceptions, Result types, or structured logging; establish a project-wide error taxonomy
