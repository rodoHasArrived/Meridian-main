This map gives maintainers a quick layer-oriented view of Meridian.

## Runtime Flow

  Host["Meridian host and CLI"] --> Application["Application workflows"]
  Application --> Domain["Domain events and models"]
  Application --> Storage["Storage and WAL"]
  Application --> Providers["Provider adapters"]
  Application --> Execution["Execution and risk"]
  Application --> UiServices["UI services and shared endpoints"]
  UiServices --> Web["Browser workstation"]
  UiServices --> Wpf["WPF desktop shell"]
```

## Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Projects | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host | `src/Meridian` | Compose services, expose CLI/API modes, and host workstation endpoints |
| Application | `src/Meridian.Application` | Coordinate workflows; keep UI and provider specifics out |
| Domain/Core/Contracts | `src/Meridian.Domain`, `src/Meridian.Core`, `src/Meridian.Contracts` | Keep business and contract types UI-independent |
| Providers/Infrastructure | `src/Meridian.Infrastructure*`, `src/Meridian.ProviderSdk` | Isolate external API integration behind provider contracts |
| Storage | `src/Meridian.Storage` | Preserve WAL and atomic-write durability expectations |
| Execution/Risk | `src/Meridian.Execution*`, `src/Meridian.Risk` | Isolate broker gateways, paper/live controls, and pre-trade validation |
| Strategy/Backtesting | `src/Meridian.Strategies`, `src/Meridian.Backtesting*`, `src/Meridian.QuantScript` | Keep strategy lifecycle, replay, and scripting reusable outside UI |
| UI Shared | `src/Meridian.Ui.Services`, `src/Meridian.Ui.Shared` | Own workstation DTO projection and endpoint/read-model support |
| UI Surfaces | `src/Meridian.Ui/dashboard`, `src/Meridian.Wpf` | Keep views thin; put state, labels, disabled reasons, and commands in view models |

## Boundary Checks

- Domain, core, storage, providers, execution, strategy, and backtesting projects
  must not depend on UI projects.
- Browser workstation logic should prefer view-model/read-model seams instead of
  hardcoding workflow state in React components.
- WPF is the active desktop shell; new desktop workflow lanes are expected and encouraged.
- Design tokens and shared UI patterns should come from the Meridian Design
  System or local shared dashboard primitives, not one-off screen styling.
