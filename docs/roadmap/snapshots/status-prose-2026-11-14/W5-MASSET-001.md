```yaml
    current_summary: Completed the shared multi-asset operations proof lane by exposing Security Master validation/profile posture, required provider evidence, ledger classification, reconciliation signals, and close-readiness blockers through `/api/workstation/portfolio/multi-asset-coverage`, with browser Portfolio/Accounting and WPF Portfolio cockpit surfaces rendering the shared read model. The v1 alternative-asset baseline now promotes `StructuredCredit`, `PrivateFundInterest`, `PrivateCompanyEquity`, `RealEstateHolding`, and `CommitmentGuarantee` into first-class Security Master classes while retaining `DirectLoan` and governed `CustomAsset` compatibility fallback rows. Live eFront/Yardi/cap-table/trustee adapter builds, new root workspaces, and core-ledger rewrites remain out of scope.
