# Meridian — Feature Inventory

**Version:** 1.7.2
**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Purpose:** Comprehensive inventory of every functional area, its current implementation status, and the remaining work required to reach full implementation.

Use this document alongside [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) (delivery waves and sequencing), [`IMPROVEMENTS.md`](IMPROVEMENTS.md) (normalized improvement/backlog tracking), and [`FULL_IMPLEMENTATION_TODO_2026_03_20.md`](FULL_IMPLEMENTATION_TODO_2026_03_20.md) (consolidated non-assembly execution backlog).

## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | Fully implemented and tested |
| ⚠️ | Partially implemented — functional with caveats |
| 🔑 | Requires external credentials / build flag |
| 🔄 | Framework in place, one or more sub-features pending |
| 📝 | Planned, not yet started |

---

## 1. Core Infrastructure

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Event Pipeline (`System.Threading.Channels`) | ✅ | Bounded channel, backpressure, 100 K capacity, nanosecond timing |
| Injectable `IEventMetrics` | ✅ | Static dependency removed; `TracedEventMetrics` decorator available |
| `CompositeSink` fan-out | ✅ | Per-sink fault isolation; JSONL + Parquet simultaneously |
| Write-Ahead Log (WAL) | ✅ | SHA-256 checksums, streaming recovery, uncommitted-size warnings |
| Provider Registry & DI | ✅ | `[DataSource]` scanning, `ProviderRegistry`, `ServiceCompositionRoot` |
| Config Validation Pipeline | ✅ | `ConfigValidationPipeline` with composable stages; obsoletes `ConfigValidationHelper` |
| Graceful Shutdown | ✅ | `GracefulShutdownService`, provider disconnect, flush-to-disk before exit |
| Category-accurate exit codes | ✅ | `ErrorCode.FromException()` maps to codes 3–7 for CI/CD differentiation |
| Dry-run mode (`--dry-run`) | ✅ | Full validation without starting collection; `--dry-run --offline` skips connectivity |
| Configuration hot-reload (`--watch-config`) | ✅ | `ConfigWatcher` triggers live config update |
| Persistent deduplication ledger | ✅ | `PersistentDedupLedger`; disk-backed dedup tracking that survives restarts |
| Ingestion job management | ✅ | `IngestionJobService`; per-symbol ingestion job lifecycle, status, and scheduling |

---

## 2. Streaming Data Providers

| Provider | Status | Remaining Work |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Alpaca** | ✅ | Credential validation, automatic resubscription on reconnect, quote routing |
| **Interactive Brokers** | 🔑 | Real runtime requires `-p:DefineConstants=IBAPI` plus the official `IBApi` surface; non-`IBAPI` builds expose simulation/setup guidance instead of broker connectivity |
| **Polygon** | ⚠️ | Real connection when API key present; committed replay fixtures close the parser path, while live reconnect/websocket throttling remain explicitly runtime-bounded |
| **Robinhood** | 🔑 | Unofficial broker-backed quote polling plus brokerage reads/orders, options chains, and historical daily bars when `ROBINHOOD_ACCESS_TOKEN` is present; runtime bounds are tracked under `artifacts/provider-validation/robinhood/2026-04-09/` |
| **NYSE** | 🔑 | Requires NYSE Connect credentials; L1/shared-lifecycle evidence is strong, with auth/rate-limit/depth bounds tracked under `artifacts/provider-validation/nyse/2026-04-09/` |
| **StockSharp** | 🔑 | Requires StockSharp connector-specific credentials + connector type config. Wave 1 validates `Rithmic`, `IQFeed`, `CQG`, and `InteractiveBrokers`; crypto connectors remain optional/example paths |
| **Failover-Aware Client** | ✅ | `FailoverAwareMarketDataClient` with `ProviderDegradationScorer`, per-provider health |
| **Streaming Failover Service** | ✅ | `StreamingFailoverService` + `StreamingFailoverRegistry`; runtime failover orchestration with configurable rules and health evaluation |
| **IB Simulation Client** | ✅ | `IBSimulationClient` for testing without live connection |
| **NoOp Client** | ✅ | `NoOpMarketDataClient` for dry-run / test harness scenarios |

Provider validation matrix and evidence links now live in `docs/status/provider-validation-matrix.md`, `docs/providers/provider-confidence-baseline.md`, and `artifacts/provider-validation/`, with `scripts/dev/run-wave1-provider-validation.ps1` as the offline gate runner.

### Remaining work to reach full provider coverage

- **Polygon**: Validate WebSocket message parsing against Polygon v2 feed schema (trades, quotes, aggregates, status messages). Add round-trip integration test with a recorded WebSocket session replay.
- **Robinhood**: Quote polling, historical bars, symbol search, options chains, and brokerage paths are in code; remaining work is explicit runtime evidence for the bounded scenarios under `artifacts/provider-validation/robinhood/2026-04-09/`.
- **StockSharp**: Runtime connector guidance and unsupported-path recovery messaging are now aligned; remaining work is moving the validated adapter set from bounded to captured runtime evidence without broadening the Wave 1 set.
- **IB**: Scripted setup instructions, version-bound tests, and a compile-only smoke-build path now exist; remaining work is keeping the vendor-runtime path validated against real IB API releases and entitlements.

## 10. WPF Desktop Application

> **Status:** Code present in `src/Meridian.Wpf/` and `tests/Meridian.Wpf.Tests/`, both included in the solution build. Builds full WPF desktop app on Windows; produces a CI-compatible stub on Linux/macOS.

### Shell & Navigation (Complete baseline)

- Workspace model now persists built-in `Research`, `Trading`, `Data Operations`, and `Governance` workspaces, including legacy workspace ID migration for older saved sessions.
- Main workstation shell is metadata-driven through `ShellNavigationCatalog`, with workspace home pages, primary/secondary/overflow navigation tiers, recent pages, command-palette search keywords, and related-workflow links.
- Workspace home pages now act as shell-first operator launchpads (`ResearchShell`, `TradingShell`, `DataOperationsShell`, `GovernanceShell`) instead of a long page-directory entry model.
- Command palette (`Ctrl+K`), keyboard shortcuts, workspace-tile switching, and governance/fund-ops aliases keep low-frequency pages reachable without promoting them to top-level roots.
- Workspace shell context strips now standardize scope, environment, freshness, review-state, alert, and currency cues across the four workstation shells.
- Legacy deep pages now route through `WorkspaceDeepPageHostPage` in both standalone and docked presentations, so direct navigation and workspace docks share the same workspace title, reachability metadata, related-workflow chrome, and trust-state posture without removing the underlying page functionality.
- Legacy deep pages can now suppress duplicate inner hero/title chrome through `WorkspaceShellChromeState` plus embedded-shell styles (`EmbeddedShellHeroCardStyle`, `EmbeddedShellHeaderGridStyle`, and `EmbeddedShellHeaderStackPanelStyle`), tightening density when pages are already hosted inside the shared workstation shell.
- Action-heavy hosted pages including `MessagingHubPage`, `NotificationCenterPage`, `SecurityMasterPage`, `ServiceManagerPage`, and `PositionBlotterPage` now collapse decorative identity chrome while preserving their page-specific commands, status badges, and trust signals inside the shared shell host.
- `PositionBlotterPage`, `SecurityMasterPage`, and `ServiceManagerPage` now go beyond top-band cleanup and render as workflow-native workbenches with persistent inspector rails for selection state, filters/runtime posture, and operator actions while preserving their existing commands and service integrations.
- Dock-hosted workspace pages are wrapped in `Frame` containers so WPF page content can be embedded safely inside the workstation docking surface.
- Theme switching, notification center, info bar
- Offline indicator (single notification + warning on backend unreachable)
- Session state persistence (active workspace, last page, window bounds)
- Shell-first regression coverage now includes DI registration checks, workspace-shell smoke tests, dock-hosting smoke tests, compact-host chrome assertions for representative legacy pages, isolated `MainPage` workflow automation, and a full registered-page navigation sweep in `tests/Meridian.Wpf.Tests/`.

### Trading workstation migration target (Planned / partially implemented)

The current WPF app exposes broad capability coverage, but the active implementation wave reorganizes those capabilities into four workflow workspaces:

- **Research** - backtests, Lean engine flows, charts, replay, experiment comparison
- **Trading** - live monitoring, orders, fills, positions, strategy operation
- **Data Operations** - providers, symbols, backfills, schedules, storage, exports
- **Governance** - portfolio, ledger, diagnostics, retention, notifications, and settings

This migration is tracked in [`../plans/trading-workstation-migration-blueprint.md`](../plans/trading-workstation-migration-blueprint.md) and [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) Waves 1-3.

### Shared run / portfolio / ledger / reconciliation baseline (In progress)

- Shared workstation DTOs now exist for run summaries/details, portfolio summaries/positions, ledger summaries, journal rows, trial balance rows, and run comparison views.
- `StrategyRunReadService`, `PortfolioReadService`, and `LedgerReadService` now derive those models from recorded strategy/backtest results.
- WPF now includes a first-pass `StrategyRuns` browser plus `RunDetail`, `RunPortfolio`, and `RunLedger` drill-in pages, and completed backtests are mirrored into that shared workstation flow.
- Run-scoped reconciliation contracts and service flows now exist through `ReconciliationRunRequest`, `ReconciliationRunSummary`, `ReconciliationRunDetail`, `ReconciliationRunService`, and `/api/workstation/reconciliation/*`.
- Governance fund operations now exposes explicit fund cash-flow projection ladders/events and account-linked multi-ledger views across consolidated, entity, sleeve, and vehicle dimensions.
- The remaining gap is broader paper/live data-source adoption, richer portfolio/ledger analytics, deeper per-entity/per-sleeve/per-vehicle posting fidelity, richer reconciliation UX, and more complete cockpit-style workflow integration.

### Known WPF limitations

- `DiagnosticsPage` reads from local process/environment; not connected to remote backend API.
- Current functionality still relies on many existing pages under the hood, but the desktop taxonomy is now aligned around `Research`, `Trading`, `Data Operations`, and `Governance`; the remaining gap is no longer basic run-browser adoption, but deeper paper/live and cockpit-level workflow integration on top of the new shared run / portfolio / ledger model.

### WPF MVVM progress

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `DashboardViewModel` | ✅ | Extracted from `DashboardPage` code-behind; `BindableBase`, bindable properties, timer management |
| Remaining pages | 🔄 | Other pages still use code-behind for business logic; ViewModel extraction ongoing per ADR-017 |

## 18. Trading Workstation Product Surfaces

This section inventories the workflow-centric product model that now sits above the older page inventory.

| Surface | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Research workspace taxonomy | Partial | Desktop vocabulary now aligns on `Research`; the remaining gap is deeper workspace-native shells and operator flows |
| Trading workspace taxonomy | Partial | Command palette and shell terminology align on `Trading`, and the Trading shell now keeps run-scoped versus account-scoped portfolio drill-ins inside the cockpit instead of bouncing operators back to `Research`; cockpit-grade execution UX remains pending |
| Data Operations workspace taxonomy | Partial | Operational pages are grouped consistently; further cross-links and workflow shells remain |
| Governance workspace taxonomy | Partial | Portfolio/ledger/diagnostics/settings surfaces are grouped conceptually, and Security Master/reconciliation drill-ins are live; broader governance-first product flows remain incomplete |
| Governance fund-ops workspace API baseline | Partial | `/api/fund-structure/workspace-view` and `/api/fund-structure/report-pack-preview` now aggregate fund-account state, banking, ledger, reconciliation, NAV attribution, and reporting profile previews for a `fundProfileId`; the Governance WPF shell now reuses the same shared projection, while workstation-shell polish and governed artifact generation remain open. Guardrail: Security Master is the sole instrument source, and governance DTOs with instrument terms must carry Security Master identity/provenance references. |
| Shared `StrategyRun` DTO/read-model baseline | Partial | Shared run summary/detail/comparison models exist; paper/live history expansion remains |
| Shared portfolio read-model baseline | Partial | Portfolio summaries/positions derived from recorded runs exist; equity-history and broader source coverage remain |
| Shared ledger read-model baseline | Partial | Ledger summaries now expose consolidated totals plus per-ledger slices (entity/sleeve/vehicle) with trial-balance/journal payloads for WPF drill-in binding; account-summary and richer reconciliation UX remain |
| Reconciliation run baseline | Partial | Run-scoped reconciliation service, history, and Security Master coverage issue detection now exist; broader break queues and non-run workflows remain |
| Security Master platform baseline | Complete | The current Security Master mechanics are delivered and workstation productization is live: hardened WPF activation, canonical `WorkstationSecurityReference` coverage/provenance, and shared research/trading/governance/portfolio/ledger propagation |
| Security Master — bond term richness | ✅ | Extended `SecurityEconomicDefinition` with coupon rate, maturity, day-count convention, seniority, callable flag, and issue price |
| Security Master — trading parameters | ✅ | Per-instrument lot size, tick size; `PaperTradingGateway` lot-size validation and `BacktestEngine` tick-size rounding wired; `GET /api/security-master/{id}/trading-parameters` |
| Security Master — corporate action events | ✅ | `Dividend`, `StockSplit`, `SpinOff`, `MergerAbsorption` domain events; `CorporateActionAdjustmentService` applies split-adjusted bar prices in backtest replay; `GET /api/security-master/{id}/corporate-actions` |
| Security Master — exchange bulk ingest | ✅ | CSV + JSON bulk-ingest via `SecurityMasterImportService`; idempotent dedup; CLI `--security-master-ingest`; `POST /api/security-master/import`; typed `GET /api/security-master/ingest/status` polling surface |
| Security Master — EDGAR ingest provider | ✅ | `EdgarSecurityMasterIngestProvider`; SEC company-ticker and submission enrichment flow with provenance capture and SEC rate-limit-aware ingest behavior |
| Security Master — golden record conflict resolution | ✅ | `SecurityMasterConflictService` detects ingest-time identifier conflicts automatically; `GET /api/security-master/conflicts` list + `POST /api/security-master/conflicts/{id}/resolve`; workstation conflict queue and operator resolution path are live |
| Security Master — WPF browser | ✅ | `SecurityMasterPage` + `SecurityMasterViewModel` (BindableBase); search, results/detail/inspector workbench, ingest polling, conflict queue, corporate action timeline, trading params, import/backfill posture, and governance drill-ins |
| Direct lending vertical slice | Partial | Postgres-backed direct-lending services, migrations, workflow support, and `/api/loans/*` endpoints are live; broader governance/reporting integration remains |
| WPF run browser/detail/portfolio/ledger surfaces | In progress | Code present in `src/Meridian.Wpf/`; included in active build |
| Backtest Studio unification | Planned | Native and Lean backtests are still distinct operator experiences |
| Paper-trading cockpit | Partial | Trading workspace surfaces now cover positions, orders, fills, replay, sessions, promotion flows, and in-shell portfolio/accounting drill-ins; cockpit hardening, broader broker validation, and stronger acceptance criteria remain |
| Promotion workflow (`Backtest -> Paper -> Live`) | Partial | Endpoint layer and dashboard flows exist; safety-gated lifecycle hardening, broader operator acceptance, and full live-readiness remain open |

### Additional governance and platform tracks

- **Cash-flow modeling surfaces:** governance-oriented cash-movement and projection views are not yet productized.
- **Multi-ledger tracking:** governance workflows do not yet expose multiple ledgers, ledger groups, or cross-ledger consolidation explicitly.
- **Reconciliation engine expansion:** run-scoped reconciliation now exists for recorded strategy runs, but broader position, cash, NAV, external statement, and exception-queue workflows remain incomplete.
- **Governance architecture review check:** flag governance-local instrument definitions unless they are adapter-only intermediates with explicit mapping to Security Master IDs/provenance before downstream DTO/service exposure.
- **Reviewer search guidance:** for governance DTO/service diffs, search for instrument terms (`Symbol`, `Cusip`, `Isin`, `Coupon`, `Maturity`, `Issuer`, `Venue`, `AssetClass`) and confirm paired Security Master reference/provenance fields.
- **Report generation tools:** export infrastructure exists and fund-scoped report-pack preview APIs now expose the first governed slice, but full investor, board, compliance, and fund-ops artifact generation is not yet productized.

### Remaining work

- Turn taxonomy alignment into true workspace-first shells with quick actions and cross-workflow entry points.
- Extend the shared run/portfolio/ledger model to paper/live history, cash-flow views, multi-ledger tracking, and richer reconciliation views.
- Elevate Security Master from backend capability to explicit platform/product infrastructure for research and governance (Wave 6 — see [`docs/plans/security-master-productization-roadmap.md`](../plans/security-master-productization-roadmap.md)).
- Treat `docs/plans/security-master-productization-roadmap.md` as canonical for Wave 6 Security Master status, and keep this table synchronized.
- Expand the current reconciliation seam into explicit break queues, match rules, exception workflows, and non-run governance use cases.
- Extend the direct-lending slice into governance-grade projections, reconciliation hooks, and reporting outputs.
- Add report generation tools that package auditable governance outputs for operators and stakeholders.
- Replace page-by-page mental models with workstation-native journeys for research, trading, data ops, and governance.

## 19. Flagship Planned Capabilities

These areas are part of the documented implementation scope even though they are not yet productized in the current repo state.

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| QuantScript library/project | ✅ | `src/Meridian.QuantScript` — Roslyn scripting API, PriceSeries/ReturnSeries domain types, StatisticsEngine, BacktestProxy, QuantDataContext, PlotQueue |
| QuantScript WPF editor/surface | ✅ | `QuantScriptPage.xaml` + `QuantScriptViewModel` — AvalonEdit editor, three-column layout, Console/Charts/Metrics/Trades/Diagnostics result tabs, ScottPlot charting |
| QuantScript tests/sample scripts/docs | ✅ | `tests/Meridian.QuantScript.Tests` (compiler, runner, stats, plot-queue); `scripts/example-sharpe.csx` sample script |
| L3 reconstruction timeline | ðŸ“ | Planned deterministic replay + merged timeline for queue inference |
| L3 inference model | ðŸ“ | Planned probabilistic queue-ahead inference with confidence scoring |
| Queue-aware execution simulator | ðŸ“ | Planned market/limit simulation with partial fills, latency, and exported artifacts |
| Simulation CLI workflow | ðŸ“ | `--simulate-execution` / calibration commands are documented but not yet implemented |
| Simulation WPF explorer | ðŸ“ | Dedicated simulation page and progress/results UX remain planned |

### Remaining work

- Convert both blueprints into real projects, contracts, tests, docs, and operator-facing entry points.
- Ensure these capabilities land on top of shared workstation models rather than as isolated feature islands.

## Target End Product Snapshot

Meridian’s intended end state is a comprehensive fund management platform rather than a loose collection of pages and utilities.

- `Research`, `Trading`, `Data Operations`, and `Governance` should operate as durable product surfaces, not only naming conventions.
- Backtests, paper sessions, and live-facing history should share one recognizable run model with first-class portfolio and ledger drill-ins.
- Account, entity, strategy-implementation, and trade-management workflows should be part of the same connected product surface.
- Security Master now serves as the authoritative instrument-definition layer across research, trading, governance, portfolio, and ledger workflows; the current repo already delivers that baseline.
- Governance should expose cash-flow modeling, trial-balance analysis, and multi-ledger tracking as first-class capabilities.
- Governance should include a reconciliation engine comparable to fund-operations tooling, plus report generation tools for audit, investor, and compliance outputs.
- Provider, replay, storage, diagnostics, and observability capabilities should support that operator workflow end to end.
- Optional scale-out and assembly-level optimization work can deepen the platform, but they are not required for the non-assembly product baseline to feel complete.
