Tracks whether DK1 pilot evidence, packet-bound operator sign-off, the trading readiness handoff, and local golden-path acceptance artifact remain present and synchronized.

## Evidence Checks

| Category | Check | Status | Score | Evidence | Missing |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Golden Path Evidence | Pilot acceptance artifact proves all eight golden-path stage gates | Gap | 0/4 | - | sources: `artifacts/pilot-acceptance/latest/pilot-readiness.json`; terms: `"allStagesReady": true`, `"readyStageCount": 8`, `"stageGates"`, `"evidenceGraph"`, `"GovernedReportPack"` |
| Provider Evidence | Pilot provider matrix covers Alpaca, Robinhood, Yahoo, and Wave 1 status | Gap | 0/2 | `docs/status/provider-validation-matrix.md` | terms: `Alpaca`, `Robinhood`, `Yahoo`, `Wave 1` |
| Provider Evidence | DK1 parity runbook names generated packet and run-date artifact requirements | Pass | 2/2 | `docs/status/evidence/dk1-pilot-parity-runbook.md` | - |
| Operator Sign-off | Kernel dashboard records signed packet-bound DK1 operator sign-off | Gap | 0/3 | `docs/status/kernel-readiness-dashboard.md` | terms: `operatorSignoff.status=signed`, `operatorSignoff.validForDk1Exit=true`, `ready-for-operator-review` |
| Automation | Provider validation, packet generation, and sign-off scripts are present | Pass | 2/2 | `scripts/dev/run-wave1-provider-validation.ps1`, `scripts/dev/generate-dk1-pilot-parity-packet.ps1`, `scripts/dev/prepare-dk1-operator-signoff.ps1` | - |
| Automation | DK1 packet and sign-off scripts have focused regression tests | Pass | 2/2 | `tests/scripts/test_generate_dk1_pilot_parity_packet.py`, `tests/scripts/test_prepare_dk1_operator_signoff.py` | - |
| Trading Readiness | Pilot posture is consumed by the shared trading readiness lane | Gap | 0/2 | `docs/plans/paper-trading-cockpit-reliability-sprint.md`, `src/Meridian.Ui.Shared/Services/Dk1TrustGateReadinessService.cs` | terms: `/api/workstation/trading/readiness`, `ProviderTrustGate` |

## Follow-up Queue

- **Pilot acceptance artifact proves all eight golden-path stage gates**: Run PilotAcceptanceHarnessTests to regenerate the pilot readiness artifact before claiming golden-path readiness.
- **Pilot provider matrix covers Alpaca, Robinhood, Yahoo, and Wave 1 status**: Refresh the provider validation matrix before claiming DK1 pilot readiness.
- **Kernel dashboard records signed packet-bound DK1 operator sign-off**: Update the kernel dashboard with the current signed, packet-bound DK1 evidence.
- **Pilot posture is consumed by the shared trading readiness lane**: Keep the DK1 trust-gate handoff wired into the shared trading readiness contract.

## Pilot Acceptance Artifact

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | not_generated |
| Path | `artifacts/pilot-acceptance/latest/pilot-readiness.json` |
| Detail | Run PilotAcceptanceHarnessTests to generate the golden-path pilot readiness artifact. |
